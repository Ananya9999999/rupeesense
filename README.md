**Financial clarity for people who've never had it.**

An AI-powered personal finance app that analyzes your spending with personality, honesty, and a touch of shame. Get real feedback on your money habits—delivered like your mom would.

---

## ✨ Features

### 🏥 **Money Health Score**
Get a 0–100 wellness score based on your spending habits. Categories with high spending (food, entertainment, shopping) reduce your score. Transportation and utilities boost it.

### 💬 **Mom's Reaction**
Click any transaction and get an immediate, personality-driven response from your AI financial coach. Playful roasts for impulse spending, praise for responsible choices.

**Examples:**
- "₹450 Swiggy? Beta, aloo gobi at home free hai! 😤"
- "₹1200 Amazon?! Shaaram karo! Kitna jyada hai!"
- "₹50 auto? Theek hai beta, responsible hona zaroori hai. ✓"

### 📊 **Weekly Report Card**
Get grades (A+, A, B, C, D, F) for each spending category with brutal honesty:
- Food spending > ₹4000? **F - Disaster**
- Shopping always over budget? **C - Think again**
- Entertainment ratio high? **D - Too much fun**

### 📈 **Category Breakdown**
Visual bars showing your spending split across Food, Shopping, Entertainment, Transport, and Utilities. See where your money actually goes.

### 📋 **Bulk Import**
Paste multiple transactions at once:
```
450, Swiggy, Food, 2024-01-10
1200, Amazon, Shopping, 2024-01-10
340, Starbucks, Food, 2024-01-09

### Key Functions

**`getMomResponse()`** - Generates personality-driven feedback based on:
- Merchant name (pattern matching for Swiggy, Amazon, Netflix, etc.)
- Amount spent
- Transaction category
- Total weekly spending

**`generateReportCard()`** - Creates weekly grades:
- Analyzes spending by category
- Assigns letter grades (A+ to F)
- Provides overall judgment

**`calcHealthScore()`** - Calculates 0–100 score:
- Food spending ratio: -40 points (high impact)
- Entertainment ratio: -30 points
- Shopping ratio: -20 points
- Transport/Utilities: Neutral/Positive

---

## 💾 State Management

Uses React `useState` for:
- `transactions` - List of all spending entries
- `reportCard` - Generated weekly report
- Form inputs: `amount`, `merchant`, `category`, `date`, `pasteText`

All data is **client-side only** — nothing is sent to servers (except the deployment domain).

## 🎯 Hackathon Build (24-hour)

This was built for a 24-hour hackathon with:
- ✅ Zero external API calls (hardcoded logic)
- ✅ Instant responses (no network latency)
- ✅ Full functionality in < 500 lines of code
- ✅ Modern glassmorphism UI
- ✅ Mobile-responsive design

**Time breakdown:**
- Hours 0–6: Core logic + inputs (getMomResponse, transaction state)
- Hours 6–12: UI design (glassmorphism, categories)
- Hours 12–18: Report card + styling
- Hours 18–24: Polish, animations, deploy

---

## 🎨 Customization

### Change Mom's Personality
Edit `getMomResponse()` in `App.tsx`:

```typescript
if (merchant.includes('Swiggy')) {
  if (amount > 500) return '₹' + amount + ' Swiggy? [YOUR RESPONSE HERE]';
}
```

### Adjust Health Score Formula
Modify weights in `calcHealthScore()`:

```typescript
const score = Math.max(0, 100 - (
  foodRatio * 40 +           // Change 40 to adjust weight
  entertainmentRatio * 30 +
  shoppingRatio * 20
));
```

### Add New Categories
In the `<select>` dropdown:

```tsx
<option>Your Category Here</option>
```

Then add matching logic in `getMomResponse()`.
